Hi, Iâ€™m @ElZeta0

I created a little script for fivem
This script is for all PVP servers.

The script consists of commands, which allow all players
to use them. The commands are: /c which is used to heal oneself, /g which is used to give oneself a bulletproof vest,
if true is set in the configuration the /r command will revive the player however if false is set in the configuration the player will be revived using the E button.

**How Install**

1 extract the folder you will install
2 add the folder into your ```resource``` folder
3 add ```ensure Zeta_commandFreeroam``` to the server.cfg

```ensure Zeta_commandFreeroam```

If you have problems with the script/installation please join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VNR2T7pvwT)
